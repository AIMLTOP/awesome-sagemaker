    "Super-resolution is a technique that aims to improve the quality of images, by taking a low-resolution image and enhancing it to make it look sharper and clearer. This process is extensively explored in the field of image processing. However, there are a couple of problems that researchers often encounter. One issue is related to the methods that use interpolation. Interpolation-based techniques try to estimate the missing details in the low-resolution image by making educated guesses based on the available information. Unfortunately, these methods often result in blurry output, where the enhanced image lacks sharpness and fine details.\n",

    "Stable Diffusion uses an AI algorithm to upscale images, eliminating the need for manual work that may require manually filling gaps in an image. It has been trained on millions of images and can accurately predict high-resolution images, resulting in a significant increase in detail compared to traditional image upscalers. Additionally, unlike non-deep-learning techniques such as nearest neighbor, Stable Diffusion takes into account the context of the image, using a textual prompt to guide the upscaling process.\n",

    "We use SageMaker Python SDK for Upscaling with state-of-the-art pre-trained Stable Diffusion models. Upscaling is the task of generating high resolution image given a low resolution image and a textual prompt describing the image. An image that is low resolution, blurry, and pixelated can be converted into a high resolution image that appears smoother, clearer, and more detailed. This process, called upscaling, can be applied to both real images and images generated by [text-to-image Stable Diffusion models](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/generate-images-from-text-with-the-stable-diffusion-model-on-amazon-sagemaker-jumpstart/). In the medical field, here are numerous studies that have tried to improve image quality for the purpose of better diagnoses & more enhanced detection by CAD (computer aided detection) systems which are very popular in radiology. Additionally, upscaling can improve the visual quality of low-resolution images when displayed on high-resolution screens.\n",

These containers include Hugging Face Transformers, Tokenizers and the Datasets library, which allows you to use these resources for your training and inference jobs. For a list of the available Deep Learning Containers images, see Available Deep Learning Containers Images.
